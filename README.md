# hello-world
This is a nice little introduction of me and my interests.

##Aboot me
I'm an engineer and fledgling WebDev based in Austria. I like to learn new things to make my code more efficient and/or prettier. If at any point you might feel that my code could be better or quicker in any way please feel free to slide into my DMs.
